[\subsection{The kick-off Meeting}]
The kick-off meeting is a face-to-face meeting at the beginning of the work phase and helps building the teamâ€™s cohesion by getting to know each other on a more personal level than is possible by means of virtual communication.
In this meeting every team member should introduce himself and the field he is working on. Telling a personal story of one's own is also important in order to establish social relations. Furthermore sharing the hopes and expectations for the project helps building a common vision and mindset.
At this opportunity the team leader will set and explain guidelines for work practices like 
 \begin{enumerate}[1.]
	\item communication
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
		  	\item internal\\ 
				e.g. questions need to be answered within a certain time, team members are to be treated with respect at all times, report to the team leader if problems or conflicts arise
			\item external\\
				e.g. spelling of the company name in a certain fashion, include a disclaimer in written communication
		\end{enumerate}
	\item documentation\\
e.g. put down all information that might be used for maintenance of the product or for further development in a project wiki.  \end{enumerate}
