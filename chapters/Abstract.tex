[\section{Abstract}]
In this paper, we characterize teams as groups of at least three people with complementary skills who are committed to a 
common purpose, performance goals, who completes their interdependent task through collaboration \cite{katzenbach2003the}.\\
 We discuss how 
teams can be virtual, which challenges follow from geographical dispersion of team members and how they can be addressed and 
overcome. Furthermore, we outline the feats that members should have in every team.\\
 Lastly, we present a list of collaboration 
tools that enable teams to work together both synchronously and asynchronously. We conclude with some our own experiences 
from the virtual work on this project and our opinion that what is considered extraordinary and challenging about virtual 
teams nowadays might not be percieved equally in the not-too-distant future.
